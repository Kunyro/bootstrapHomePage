                    <p>Homepage for cs50 that I had to do during week 8 which is the week that comed after 7 and before 6. I used to think that the number 8 was a weird number due a meme in argentina that consist of the number 8 being replies a by a joke that roughly translates to "i clip your behind". I realize now that when translated to english the joke doesnt hit the same but it nonetheless does not change my opinions on the number 8.</p>

                        Carus boyfriend didnt want to work for google,
                        he didnt want to be director of the ai department
                        and get paid over 200k a year. That wasn't his goal.
                        He didnt have a goal. Well he did but his goal wasnt
                        a destination, it wasn't fixed, it wasn't a planned movement.
                        His goal was an act, a thing that he wanted to do and enjoyed.

                        After I am done with CS50, I will make a short,
                        Megaman like boss rush game. Then I will start CS50AI
                        and also start grinding out Leetcodes. I will also contact
                        the most companies as possible to see if I can get an
                        internship or even possibly a job.

                        I am planning on going to Vietnam this summer with friends.
                        I will probably stay there for like two weeks but I am not
                        sure yet. I need to get a part time job to stck up some more
                        money because this trip is gonna be expensive.

                        I plan on making a short Megaman boss rush fan game and
                        uploading it on itch.io as a web-game so stay tuned for that
                        I guess.

                    <p>
                        People associate the insects to evil that wants to destroy humans and
                        are consuming the territory and creating a "sea of dread" but in reality,
                        they are a reflection of humans behavior.
                        They represent the earths revenge against humans.
                        They are allies of nature, most humans are not.
                        The main character understands this and becomes one with nature realizing
                        that we should try to live together with the earth instead of fighting it.
